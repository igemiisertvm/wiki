Being the first team from our institute and Kerala, not many people were aware of the iGEM competition. The team's effort was instrumental in introducing iGEM within our institution. We have, so far, had no courses on iGEM or synthetic biology. The idea to take part in iGEM bloomed when a group of enthusiastic students came forward with a project proposal. <br />
<br>
The initial brainstorming and quest to learn more about iGEM began in August 2020. Leaning about its various sections, requirements, and medal criteria were the baby steps. Eventually, more team members joined and various ideas were discussed upon. We finally decided on the project, now named “MOLDEMORT” during December 2020. The project has seen many changes as we went by.
Due to the covid-19 pandemic, the team could start their initial work of identifying the fungus in the campus premises only by February 2021. We have been trained to handle fungus since then by our advisor.
<br />
<br>
The lab work for the project started in the month of May with the team members getting trained to carry out the experiments properly, analyze the data, and do necessary troubleshoots. We successfully designed 4 different recombinant chitinases, out of which one chitinase was successfully cloned and expressed. Adding to the achievement, we were able to establish the antifungal activity of our purified protein. We also performed a comparative antifungal study between our chimeric chitinase and the wild type.
<br />
<br>
We spread the word of Synthetic Biology to the community through various fun and engaging games and talk series as well as courses for students. With respect to our project, we spread awareness to the local public about fungi and their pernicious nature. Each member improved their teamwork skills as well as raised their standards to an international level.
<br /><br>
We hereby acknowledge help from the following individuals and organisations for making this project a success.
<br />
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Principal Investigators</h2>
<b>Ravi Maruthchalam</b>, Assistant Professor, School of Biology, IISER Thiruvananthapuram. The entire team expresses their heartiest gratitude to him for guiding us through the journey of iGEM, guiding us through the construction of the parts, primers, reviewing our work and helping in troubleshooting, helping out in administering the project, providing us lab space to work and constant motivation to do our best.
<br />
<br />
<b>Prof. S. Murty Srinivasula</b>, Professor, School of Biology, IISER Thiruvananthapuram. He is the former Registrar of the institution, who helped us get the approval to carry out the project from the Institution and IBSC (Institutional Biosafety Committee). Being a biologist himself, he guided us through some experimental protocols and looked up the constant updates of the project.
<br />
<br>
<h2>Team members</h2>

<b>Tejas Sabu</b>, the team leader, had been involved in all wet-lab activities. He had been responsible for all the official documentation so that the project could run smoothly with all necessary approvals.
