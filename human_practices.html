                              <p align="center" style="font-size:27px"><strong>Overview</strong></p>

        <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Amidst the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, a group of undergraduate students from IISER Thiruvananthapuram came across iGEM. Being extremely keen on synthetic biology and recognizing the potential iGEM had to develop their interest in synbio, they decided to give it a shot.
        </p>
      <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Our search for a plausible iGEM project led us to scour through numerous wikis of erstwhile iGEM teams. Catechewing coli- an eco-friendly enzyme to remove paan stains from walls by iGEM Ruia Mumbai 2018 grabbed our attention. Taking inspiration from their project, we explored many different issues, primarily prioritizing environmental concerns.
    </p>
    <p class="pl-20 pr-20">We also observed black patches on walls, later identified as a collection of several mold species. We decided to develop an antifungal enzyme in the form of recombinant chitinases to eradicate black mold thriving on walls of buildings because they were nasty to look at. We started working along this line and identified a few fungal species growing on our campus’ walls. Our interactions with protein biologists helped us design gene sequences that would later produce our recombinant chitinases.
    </p>
      <p class="pl-20 pr-20">  Dr. Binod Parameswaran pointed out the difficulties of manufacturing an enzyme for application in external settings due to concerns over its stability and the high cost-benefit ratio. He suggested that we could make a more significant impact through our project by showing us the plight caused by fungi in mainly two domains: health and agriculture.
    </p>
      <p class="pl-20 pr-20">  Prevention is better than cure. Developing an enzyme that would remove molds from walls would substantially prevent the diseases they caused. This belief of ours largely met with dissent from many medical experts whom we consulted to assess the impact of our project. Regardless of medical experts not being our direct stakeholders, our correspondence with them helped us realize that removing molds from walls would not significantly reduce the fungal spore contamination in the atmosphere. The persistent fungal spores can still lead to severe complications in people. Additionally, our parallel dialogue with local farmers pointed at agricultural losses due to fungal infestation, especially in rubber plantations.
    </p>
    <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Consequently, we were open to two choices:</p>
    <ol class="ordered-list"><li><p> An antifungal therapeutic solution to fungal infections in humans.</p>
      </li>
  <li><p> An antifungal solution to the havoc wreaked by losses in agriculture due to fungal infestation.
  </li></ol>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">During this time, India witnessed an enormous soar in the number of Mucormycosis cases as a post covid complication. This essentially helped us in resolving the dilemma and chose to work on the former option, ergo <b>‘Moldemort’</b>- a class of antifungal therapeutics to invasive fungal infections. In addition to the recombinant genes we had already designed, our team developed a new gene from two bacterial species, mainly to target <i>Rhizopus spp.</i>, which is one of the main causative agents of Mucormycosis.</p>
    <p class="pl-20 pr-20">We also indulged in interactions with our stakeholders through surveys and awareness programmes to educate the public about fungi and their menace. Their feedback and suggestions, along with a discussion with Dr. Rachit Agarwal, were instrumental in designing our drug-delivery system. Dr. Ravindra Ghooi’s guidance helped us devise a plan for implementing the future aspects, including commercialization and clinical trials.

                            <p align="center" style="font-size:27px"><strong>Understanding the problem</strong></p><br>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Fungal diseases have been on a rise with over 1 billion cases of fungal infections every year. <b>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs)</b> result in approximately <b>1.7 billion deaths per year</b> making it one of the most vicious diseases in the current scenario<sup>[1]</sup>. During the <b>Covid-19 pandemic</b>, there was a rapid increase in the IFI cases worldwide, especially in our country, India. IFIs also carry a 60-90% mortality rate among all ICU patients<sup>[2]</sup>. Although fungal infections have been on the rise, it wasn't until the wake of Covid-19 that this issue was brought to the limelight. Even before the pandemic, fungal infections had have been on a rise due to <b>increasing usage of medical devices such as catheters<sup>[3]</sup> or cardiac valves (formation of biofilms),immunosuppressants and organ transplants.</b>There are currently five classes of antifungal drugs such as Azoles, Polyenes, Echinocandins<sup>[4]</sup> etc. Most of these antifungal drugs target similar pathways involving ergosterol biosynthesis. Tackling these infections has proven difficult due to a limited repertoire of antifungal drugs, their costs, drug interactions, the routes of administration, and side effects like nephrotoxicity <sup>[5],[6]</sup>. Furthermore, the rampant use of these limited drugs raises the alarming possibility of developing drug-resistant fungal strains.
                              <sup>[7]</sup>. </p>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Aware of this issue, our team at IISER-TVM set out to develop a solution to alleviate the suffering of millions of people across the world. We embarked on a journey to understand the underlying principles of fungal infections and tried to address the root cause of the issue. Almost immediately, the stark inadequacy of existing antifungal drugs was glaringly apparent. <b>Existing therapeutics</b> not only foreshadow the emergence of <b>drug-resistant fungal strains</b>, as proven by many studies but may also have significant <b>cytotoxic and nephrotoxic effects<sup>[8]</sup>.</b></p>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20" style="font-size:20px" style="font-family:'Garamond'"><strong><i>Our efforts culminated in the development of "Moldemort,"  a novel antifungal agent, which we believe holds the potential to reduce the global burden of invasive fungal infections significantly.</i></strong> </p><br>
                            <p align="center" style="font-size:27px"><strong>Designing the Solution</strong></p><br>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Once we understood our problem, we conducted in-depth literature studies to formulate recombinant chitinases. We laid out the experimental plans planned out through intensive brainstorming sessions. To better understand and assess the problem, the team met various experts from diverse fields and significant stakeholders. </p>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">The expert interactions we conducted greatly influenced our experimental plan. Our parallel interaction with stakeholders gave us insights into the potential broader impact of our project and methods to address the gaps between what society wanted and what we had. Furthermore, we shifted the project’s initial goal of tackling fungal infestation on walls to develop a novel antifungal therapeutic solution solely based on our stakeholders’ inputs. Additionally, we added BC2-our fourth recombinant chitinase combo, to our initial list of three. This gene was purely designed against <i>Rhizopus spp.</i>, which is the causative agent of Mucormycosis.
                            </p>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Further studies on this matter led us to realize that India has a relatively higher load of invasive fungal infections among the affected Asian population. The need for affordable and effective antifungal drugs with minimum side effects dramatically increased the relevance of our project, particularly in the Indian scenario.

<ol class="ordered-list">
    <li>The team had designed 4 different recombinant chitinases that include domains from various plants and bacteria.</li>
     <li>The primary application of our chitinase was to remove moulds from walls. There were some ideas of using it as a therapeutic drug or as a biocontrol agent in Agriculture.  </li>
     <li>If a therapeutic drug was the choice, we planned on using nanoparticles as a drug delivery vehicle.</li>
    </ol>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
    <li>Using only enzymes on walls had several challenges like:
      <br>
          a. Enzyme optimum temperature and pH might not be maintained. <br>
          b. Enzyme loses stability quickly. <br>
          c. The cost of production would be very high. <br>
          d. The protein solution might induce the growth of some other microbes. <br>
          e. The enzyme solution might have non-specific activity (affect insects).</ul>
           <li> Some types of stabilizers (polysaccharides) could be added like sorbitol or starch to increase the shelf life of our protein. </li>
<li>Could look into further applications like:<br>
  a. Therapeutic Drug with the proper delivery mechanism. <br>
  b. Biocontrol agent in Agriculture. <br>
  c. As an ointment or anti-dandruff product. </li>

<li> If planning on a therapeutic drug, we need to account for the immune response, the localization of the product and the cost of developing it.
<br>
 a. Using magnetic nanoparticles to allow localization of a drug to the target site.<br>
 b. Using a cocktail of enzymes to make it more effective. </li> </ul>
<li> If the idea is still to be used on walls, then we can think about using the engineered organism to produce our enzyme upon induction.
<br>
 a. The organism can be incorporated into bricks or paints.</li>
<li>For expressing bacterial chitinases, <i>E.coli</i> is a good choice whereas Eukaryotic chitinases are best produced in Eukaryotic cell lines like <i>Pichia pastoris.</i>  </li>

As a result, we wanted to ensure that our recombinant chitinases would help resolve this issue. An exact solution cannot be designed without rigorous laboratory experiments; however, we could conduct studies on antifungal resistance in 96-well plates. Moreover, targeting multiple molecules in the fungal cell wall (glucan and chitin) simultaneously can increase the success percentage of the antifungal activity of the drug.</p>

 <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Dr Rachit Agarwal is an assistant professor at the Centre for Biosystems Science and Engineering, IISc Bangalore. His lab focuses on using a wide range of tools and concepts such as nano and micro particles, hydrogels, scaffolds and 3D organoids to generate treatment for diseases like tuberculosis and osteoarthritis. His insights were highly valuable to design an efficient drug-delivery system for the therapeutic we were developing.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Our project would be successful only if it happens to be of any use to the common man. Our initial idea was to engineer a hollow capsule that would carry our recombinant chitinase to the human body. Dr. Agarwal’s expertise in nano-particle drug-delivery systems proved to be of great help to us. He stated that nano-encapsulation of our recombinant chitinase would be an easier and efficient technique than a capsule. His advice of using Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) as the nano-polymer was incorporated into our project as it would elicit a very minimal immune response. Furthermore, he also stressed the importance of using stabilizers like Trehalose for increased shelf-life of the drug.

<li>Even though most of the drugs do not take into account active targeting during their manufacture, it is still a better option to use it. Active targeting is able to significantly increase the quantity of drug delivered to the target site compared to free drug or passively targeted nanosystems. This is achieved through the decoration of the nanocarrier surfaces with receptors (in our case dectin-1) binding to the beta-glucans found on fungal cell walls.

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Dr. Ravindra Ghooi was the Director of Scientia Clinical Services for the past 14 years. He was a professor at the Symbiosis School of Medical Sciences teaching and guiding students in Drug Development and Clinical Research. He has also worked as the DEAN of Bilcare Research Academy, an academy dedicated to Clinical Research Education. He was also the Vice President of CliniRx Research Pvt. Ltd. Having worked as a Medical Advisor in different Pharmaceuticals, his extensive knowledge in Clinical Research Education helped the team gain insights on marketing our product.</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Our interaction with Dr. Ghooi was primarily for us to learn about the procedures to commercialize the antifungal drug we were developing. His expertise in this area of clinical trials, market policies, and the explicit presentation of facts turned out to be really helpful for us. His suggestions were instrumental in devising a plan for implementing our project.

    <li>The aim of our project is to produce a novel, safe, and effective antifungal drug for therapeutic use.
</li>
<li>With the team’s background in research, our focus was primarily on the design, cloning, expression, purification, and in vitro characterisation of the antifungal molecules, leveraging synthetic Biology techniques.
</li>
<li>We lacked a comprehensive understanding of the drug discovery process beyond the first steps; having a hypothesis and generating a new drug molecule.
</li>
<li>We had only a preliminary understanding about the classification of drug molecules, the definition of a new drug, various regulatory committees and bodies involved, different stages of preclinical and clinical trials, the regulatory and ethical approval required at each of these stages, regulations on the price of new drugs, timeline and cost of the drug discovery process, tie-ups with pharmaceutical companies etc.

<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>The interaction with Dr Ghooi opened our eyes to the practical side of drug development beyond the laboratory. He broadened our understanding on various topics, such as the ones mentioned earlier.
</li>
  <li>We appreciated that most drugs take 12-15 years to reach the market, and millions of dollars are spent on their development.</li>
  <li>Thus, it becomes imperative to “see ahead of the curve” so to speak, and assess whether the drug is likely to be valuable in the future, more so than in the present.</li>
<li>Dr. Ghooi outlined a rough strategy for us to follow: a) decide which specific fungal species we are targeting,b) Identify incidences of infection by that particular species from medical literature to determine its prevalence, c) Identify existing drugs in the market and determine their annual sales from the IMS database; pay special attention to the rate at which the sales are going up/declining, d) Make a realistic comparison of our compound to the existing drugs on the market based on factors such as efficacy, safety, and price.</li>
<li>He also suggested that we pay close attention to the nature of clinical trials which we need to follow: they are likely to differ from conventional drugs since we are targeting invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.
</li>
<li>Dr Ghooi also directed us to explore the possibility of patenting our drug, and register our clinical trials on the clinical trials registry of India whenever applicable.

<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> He was able to capture our attention by giving case studies of Aspergillus spp. causes allergic reactions and in extreme cases leads to Aspergilloma and invasive Aspergillosis. A major reason why the patients’ conditions deteriorate quickly and their recovery become difficult is due to the absence of proper diagnostic tests in the early stages of the disease. Also, the treatment of IFIs using existing antifungals may span several weeks, and patients facing a financial crisis may not be able to afford the treatment at times.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> He suggested we expand our project to developing a diagnostic tool as it was a major problem to be addressed while dealing with fungal infections. Even though we did not do much in this, we looked in the literature about the possibility of using chitinases as markers for fungal infection diagnostic tests. Since the initial studies sounded quite promising, we would explore this idea further in the future phase of our project.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><b> What did we learn from them?</b></p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> We learned that removing molds from walls will not reduce the fungal contamination in the atmosphere. The remnant fungal spores in the atmosphere can still lead to health complications in immunocompromised individuals. Manufacturing a therapeutic to fungal infections is a better solution than removing black mold from walls to prevent infections caused by them.

    <br>
    <p class="pl-20 pr-20">“Infestation by Phytophthora spp. causes rotting of fruits and abnormal leaf fall during the early monsoon period. We generally spray the Bordeaux mixture prior to monsoon to prevent infestation. However, the practice is often not appropriately done considering the labor cost and profit. Lack of treatment often leads to heavy loss in production. These days, oil-based copper oxychloride is substituting Bordeaux mixture. In nursery plants, during heavy monsoon, Phytophthora causes shoot rot. From January to March, mist leads to an outbreak of powdery mildew. Oidium haevea is thought to be responsible for this. Tender leaf edges roll inwards to fall, and old leaves show necrotic shots. The overall production of rubber trees decreases. To prevent the outbreak of powdery mildew, sulfur dust is sprayed along with early morning mist. Canker of the bark occurs in tapping channels in moist weather, leads to unnecessary loss of latex. During heavy rains, black rot occurs in renewed barks of tapping channels. Phytophthora and Pythium cause both these diseases. Disinfection of tapping channel with Mancozeb and Dithane is done weekly to prevent infection.”

<p class="pl-20 pr-20" style="font-size:27px" align="center"><strong>Dear Fungi</strong></p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> India celebrates the 19th of June as Reading Day every year. This celebration is marked in the memory and honor of P. N. Panicker, father of Kerala's Library and Literacy movement. As part of the occasion, we conducted 'Dear Fungi,' a letter-writing competition for which children between the ages of 11 and 16 [ mainly high school students] were required to write a letter to any fungus/fungi of their interest.</p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Children are often affected by fungal infections, especially dermatological fungal infections. This makes them a principal class of stakeholders, and thus, educating them about different kinds of fungi also becomes essential. Taking into account the fact that most Indian education syllabi do not discuss fungi in their high school curriculum, the objectives of 'Dear Fungi' included:</p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
<li>Educate the students about various kinds of fungi:<br>
a. Edible and non-edible<br>
b. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic</li>
<li>Make the students able to distinguish between fungi and other lower microscopic organisms.</li></ol>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">We received 36 entries for the contest. As mentioned in the guidelines, the letters were addressed to a fungus/fungi of their choice. While some wrote about the havoc caused by fungi, others wrote about its benefits. The judgment criteria were the following:</p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
<li>Depth of knowledge about fungi</li>
<li>Writing style</li>
</ol>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">The winner was awarded 'Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World', a book authored by Rachel Ignotofsky which highlights notable women's contributions to STEM.</p>
<h3><b>DSoF: Dark Side of Fungi</b></h3>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><strong>Schedule:</strong></p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><strong>General description:</strong></p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">“Dark Side of Fungi” (DSoF), as the name suggests, aimed at educating the general public, one of our critical stakeholders, about the plight caused by fungi. Fungal diseases/infections are generally not an issue of prime importance, which justifies the lack of awareness programmes held in this regard. Moreover, the results of the survey we conducted during the initial stages of our project validated our understanding.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">DSoF mainly focused on fulfilling the below-mentioned objectives:
<ol class="ordered-list"><li>Increase public awareness about the causes and types of fungal diseases, and also about methods to prevent the diseases.</li>
<li>Understand the gravity of the issue of antifungal resistance.</li>
<li>Elaborate on the difference/change Moldemort can bring about in this scenario.</li>
<li>Demonstrate the relevance of our project.</li></ol>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">It is only when we present our problem in an explicit and clear-cut manner can the solution be understood better. Accordingly, the talks on the first two days of the series focused on highlighting the issue of fungal infections and antifungal resistance. A confab followed this on the third and final day about our project and how it is a novel and effective solution to the problems raised in the first two talks.
The series was conducted in an online mode through Google Meet. We received an enormous 160 registrations ranging from people of 16 years to 50 years. However, the registered participants majorly fell under the age group of 20-25 years, i.e., undergraduate students. The talks were around 45-60 minutes long and were followed by a question-answer session. The question-answer session was also lively and all doubts raised were cleared by the speaker.

<h3>Stakeholder</h3>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Fr. Jeejo<br>
Director-Pope Paul Mercy Home<br>
Mar Kundukulam Memorial Research and Rehabilitation Centre, Thrissur, Kerala</p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><b><i>Distributing medicines through ART centers will ensure that they reach the people in need of it.</i></b></p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">AIDS patients form a significant section of immunocompromised individuals and thereby are our direct stakeholders. However, directly contacting them was an issue because most NGOs and similar organizations would not share the contact details of their patients due to data privacy issues. This is precisely why we contacted Fr. Jeejo, the Director at Mar Kundukulam Memorial Research and Rehabilitation Centre. As the name suggests, the organization was established for the rehabilitation and care of terminally ill AIDS patients in 1999. Fr. Jeejo spoke to us on behalf of the AIDS patients at the center.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is available free of cost to anyone availing it. The ART therapy for patients is done in phases depending on their physical conditions and age. They have witnessed infections (or adverse reactions) in patients while shifting from one drug to another. The advancements in ART and constant follow-ups of the patients’ conditions by healthcare workers have improved the conditions of AIDS patients in younger generations. Transmission from affected mothers to babies has also reduced drastically.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Moreover, the ART center is equipped with skin specialists, psychiatrists, and other medical professionals for the well-being of the patients. AIDS patients in their organization are well taken care of. Fungal infections in AIDS patients are reported at times, but timely treatment has not led to severe complications. He suggested distributing our antifungal drug through ART centers would help make sure that these medicines reach the right individuals.
</p>
<h3>Stakeholder</h3>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Dr. Chintu Ravishankar, Ph. D.<br>
Associate Professor<br>
Department of Veterinary Microbiology<br>
College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences<br>
Pookode, Wayanad, Kerala.</p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><b><i>Sell your drug at a lower prices, because generally people do not spend too much for treating animals.
</i></b></p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Dr. Chintu comes across fungal infections in dogs and cats, and most of them are skin infections caused by dermatophytes. Even though subcutaneous and deep mycoses infections are found in animals, they are not commonly detected.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Apart from dermatological infections, Aspergillosis is another fungal infection that commonly affects birds, especially poultry. It affects chicken during the cold season, due to improper hatching of eggs and less care given. Birds infected with Aspergillosis may cough or can have other respiratory distress. Other deep-seated and invasive fungal infections are present in animals but are not detected often due to our inability to diagnose without them showing any visible symptoms. Hence, they are revealed only during the post-mortem of deceased animals.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Azoles are the most common drug used for the treatment of animals. However, there have been cases of unresponsiveness to antifungals due to antifungal resistance. Also, dogs and cats are more susceptible to fungal infections than other domestic animals.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">He suggested developing an ointment targeting dermatological infections in animals. Furthermore, the market price should be reasonably low, as people generally do not spend much for treating animals.
</p>

<h3>Expert</h3>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Dr. David Denning<br>
Chief Executive<br>
Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections</p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">The Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections (GAFFI) is the only international NGO focussed on raising awareness of and collecting worldwide data on fungal disease. Their mission is to reach the poor and vulnerable through access to rapid tests and antifungal drugs.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Dr. Denning pointed out that our project was essential in the global scenario, mainly because of the terrible outbreak of Mucormycosis India witnessed. According to him, the reasons were many:
</p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>The existing therapeutics are not good enough and are administered late.
</li>
  <li>The current antifungal drugs have acquired resistance. Example: Candida spp. are developing resistance to azoles.</li>
  <li>The patient is immunocompromised.
</li>
  <li>Inability to diagnose IFIs at an early stage.</li></ol>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">  He gave us insights into how chitinases, being large molecules, can be allergenic and lead to asthma in some instances. This might raise regulatory concerns. We should also have a solution to the consequences of our nanoparticles crossing the blood-brain barrier and leading to meningitis or other inflammations. Dr. Denning introduced us to TPP (Target Product Profile) and gave us tips to make one for a drug.

<h3><b>Survey on the incidence of fungal infections among people residing in Kerala</b>
</h3>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Please find the survey<a href="https://forms.gle/nMPVUdjtWiTfupud6" class="text-warning"> here.</a></p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">This survey aims to check the incidence of fungal infections and their awareness among the general public in Kerala. We chose the survey Since the survey was directed only towards the residents of Kerala, it was translated into Malayalam. Mrs. Ajitha K., a lecturer in Malayalam at Victoria College, Palakkad, Kerala, verified our translation.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">From analysing the survey, we realized that most of the respondents were not aware of fungi and fungal infections. Since the respondents were from varying age groups, we conducted the following specific awareness programmes for each of them.
<ol class="ordered-list">
 <li>The World of Fungi- A book for children on fungi</li>
<li>Dear Fungi- A letter writing competition </li>
<li>The Dark Side of Fungi- A talk series on fungi and fungal infections for the general public.
</li>
</ol></p>
<h3><b>Survey on Drug preferences of the public</b>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Please find the survey<a href="https://forms.gle/TxqjwpmosGkNF3gF8" class="text-warning"> here.</a></p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">  Our project aimed to develop a therapeutic solution to Invasive Fungal Infections. Before being marketed as a therapeutic, it was necessary to understand public opinion about the same. Therefore, the purpose of this survey was to analyze the public’s preferences in the medicines they use. The survey was open to people all over the world.
</p>
  Image: PNG
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">The image clearly shows that most people preferred a chemical/protein-based drug over a GMO. Moldemort is also therapeutic, which will be marketed as a protein-based drug.

<h3><b>The World of Fungi</b>
</h3>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Children are an important group of stakeholders of the antifungal therapeutic we are developing. Therefore, it is necessary to spread awareness among children about different fungi, specifically pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi. ‘The World of Fungi’ is a fun and illustrious book curated by the team to educate children, especially children below 11 years, about the same. The outreach department of our team went through several children’s books. ‘Alice in Wonderland’ was a massive inspiration to us, and we thought of introducing several species of fungi in an imaginary fungal forest.

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Features of the book:
  <ol class="ordered-list">
    <li>Target audience: The book is mainly targeted at kids aged 7 to 10 years old. Dermatophyte infections are common in kids, and hence educating them regarding the same is essential to prevent such infections in them.
</li>
    <li>Illustrations: Fungi species are introduced as attractive illustrations to gather the attention of kids. Visual representations of concepts often enable kids to understand them better.
</li>
    <li>Nature of language: The book has been written in easy language to understand it better. We tried our very best to keep our content short and informative.
</li>
    <li>Games: Books with just content alone might be boring to kids. We included games to increase their interest further.
</li>
    <li>Q&A sections: This segment was included to improve the critical thinking skills of kids further. The questions were framed to enable the kid to think and answer them by understanding the concepts introduced in the book.
</li>
    <li>Safety guidelines: This section explains methods to prevent and control common fungal infections. This will help kids to remain healthy and protect them from harmful fungi.

<h3><b>Legal Landscape of Biotechnology in India</b></h3>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">'Legal Landscape of Biotechnology in India' is a compendium of Indian biotechnology laws and International protocols of which India is a signatory, along with gaps in them aimed at novice scientists/researchers in India. Furthermore, it can serve as a reference/guide for first-time iGEM teams of the country. This handbook is a collaborative effort of the iGEM IISER_TVM and IISER-Tirupati_India.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">As a first-time iGEM team and the first from our state, we faced our fair share of obstacles and hurdles to commence our work. During those times, the <a href="http://2017.igem.org/wiki/images/0/0d/Stockholm_HP_Handbook.pdf" class="text-warning">Human Practices handbook </a>by iGEM Stockholm 2017 served as a guide and provided a foundation on where we could work. Thinking on similar lines, the idea of our handbook arose.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Being students of science, most of our knowledge was restricted to STEM alone. As a result, the handbook initially aimed at simply compiling the existing synthetic biology laws in the country. Our instructor, Ankit Kumar Pradhan, proposed to bring a different perspective by looking for loopholes/gaps in the laws we identify. Keeping this in mind, along with the iGEM team of IISER Tirupati, we identified 14 relevant biotechnology laws of the country and classified them into four categories, namely:</p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>Animal Experimentation and Clinical Trials
</li>
  <li>Export-Import Policies</li>
  <li>Environmental Safety
</li>
  <li>Biocontainment and Biowarfare</li></ol>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">  Each category corresponds to each chapter which contains relevant laws related to the topic and briefly summarizes each of them. It is followed by the gaps/loopholes we identified for the laws. Furthermore, each chapter concludes with a few directions for future Indian iGEM teams.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">During the making of the book, we understood that most of the laws in 'Biocontainment and Biowarfare' overlapped with those in the other three sections. Hence, we decided to omit the last section, but its components would be appropriately available in the other three sections. Moreover, the augmentation of relevant international protocols and treaties of which India is a signatory has also helped us in gaining a broader idea of the legal system of the country.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">This handbook does not have any section particularly related to Intellectual Property Rights, Patenting Rules, Biowarfare etc. We have not deliberately obliterated those sections. iGEM teams in the future can work on making a second volume to the book.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">The present state of the handbook would not have been possible without the help of several experts. The inputs from individuals in numerous fields helped in shaping the handbook.
</p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>Dr. Harilal Madhavan, School of Humanities, IISER Thiruvananthapuram, helped us during the initial stages of the making.
</li>
    <li>Ms. Parvathy, a graduate of National Law School, helped us a great deal by restructuring and refining the framework of the handbook.
</li>
      <li>Dr. Subha C. C., Assistant Professor, School of Law, Christ University, Delhi NCR campus, guided us in validating the loopholes we identified for each law/rule.
</li>
        <li>Dr. Satish Khurana, Assistant Professor, School of Biology, IISER Thiruvananthapuram.</li>
          <li>Dr. Poonam Thakur, Assistant Professor, School of Biology, IISER Thiruvananthapuram.
</li>
            <li>Dr. V. Stalin Raj, Associate Professor, School of Biology, IISER Thiruvananthapuram.</li>
              <li>Dr. Ullasa Kodandaramaiah, Associate Professor, School of Biology, IISER Thiruvananthapuram.</li>
              <li>Dr. Jishy Varghese, Assistant Professor, School of Biology, IISER Thiruvananthapuram.</li>
              <li>Mr. Sudin Babu, Deputy Registrar, Purchase & Stores, IISER Thiruvananthapuram.</li>
            </ol>
            Handbook
            <br>
<p align="center" style="font-size:27px"><strong>Human Practices: The Conclusion</strong></p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Each advancement in the project was a result of in-depth literature studies and several interactions we had among ourselves, with experts and stakeholders. Human Practices are inevitable in any iGEM project because this is where the developers interact with society.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">The various interactions we held helped us discover several sides to the problem we aimed to tackle. Human practices aided us in understanding the broader impact of our project and the potential adverse effects our project can have on society. This highlights the dual nature of the project,i.e., we significantly contribute to its development by possibly trying or making efforts to improve further and reduce the harm. Being from a scientific background, solely focussing on the subject matters was a usual routine for us. We were entirely new to the market regulations of our country. We understood the importance of data protection, privacy, and consent while conducting research.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">  We missed out on several stakeholders due to the time constraints and the Covid scenario in the country. Our project is still under development, and we hope to meet various experts and stakeholders we have not reached out to in the future phases.
</p>
