                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Fungal diseases have been on a rise with over 1 billion cases of fungal infections every year. Invasive fungal infections  (IFIs) result in approximately 1.7 billion deaths per year making it one of the most vicious diseases in the current scenario<sup>[1]</sup>. During the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a rapid increase in the IFI cases worldwide, especially in our country, India. IFIs also carry a 60-90% mortality rate among all ICU patients<sup>[2]</sup>. Although fungal infections have been on the rise, it wasn't until the wake of Covid-19 that this issue was brought to the limelight. Even before the pandemic, fungal infections had have been on a rise due to <b> increasing usage of medical devices such as catheters<sup>[3]</sup> or cardiac valves (formation of biofilms),</b>immunosuppressants and organ transplants.There are currently five classes of antifungal drugs such as Azoles, Polyenes, Echinocandins<sup>[4]</sup> etc. Most of these antifungal drugs target similar pathways involving ergosterol biosynthesis. Tackling these infections has proven difficult due to a limited repertoire of antifungal drugs, their costs, drug interactions, the routes of administration, and side effects like nephrotoxicity <sup>[5],[6]</sup>. Furthermore, the rampant use of these limited drugs raises the alarming possibility of developing drug-resistant fungal strains <sup>[7]</sup>. </p>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Aware of this issue, our team at IISER-TVM set out to develop a solution to alleviate the suffering of millions of people across the world. We embarked on a journey to understand the underlying principles of fungal infections and tried to address the root cause of the issue. Almost immediately, the stark inadequacy of existing antifungal drugs was glaringly apparent. <b>Existing therapeutics not only foreshadow the emergence of drug-resistant fungal strains, as proven by many studies but may also have significant cytotoxic and nephrotoxic effects<sup>[8]</sup>.</b></p>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20"><b>Our efforts culminated in the development of "Moldemort,"  a novel antifungal agent, which we believe holds the potential to reduce the global burden of invasive fungal infections significantly. </b></p>
                            <h3 align="center"><strong>Designing the Solution</strong></h3><br>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Once we understood our problem, we conducted in-depth literature studies to formulate recombinant chitinases. We laid out the experimental plans planned out through intensive brainstorming sessions. To better understand and assess the problem, the team met various experts from diverse fields and significant stakeholders. </p>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">The expert interactions we conducted greatly influenced our experimental plan. Our parallel interaction with stakeholders gave us insights into the potential broader impact of our project and methods to address the gaps between what society wanted and what we had. Furthermore, we shifted the project’s initial goal of tackling fungal infestation on walls to develop a novel antifungal therapeutic solution solely based on our stakeholders’ inputs. Additionally, we added BC2-our fourth recombinant chitinase combo, to our initial list of three. This gene was purely designed against Rhizopus spp., which is the causative agent of Mucormycosis.
                            </p>
                            <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Further studies on this matter led us to realize that India has a relatively higher load of invasive fungal infections among the affected Asian population. The need for affordable and effective antifungal drugs with minimum side effects dramatically increased the relevance of our project, particularly in the Indian scenario.

    </ol>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>

          c. The cost of production would be very high. <br>
          d. The protein solution might induce the growth of some other microbes. <br>
          e. The enzyme solution might have non-specific activity (affect insects).</ul>
           <li> Some types of stabilizers (polysaccharides) could be added like sorbitol or starch to increase the shelf life of our protein. </li>
<li>Could look into further applications like:<br>
  a. Therapeutic Drug with the proper delivery mechanism. <br>
  b. Biocontrol agent in Agriculture. <br>
  c. As an ointment or anti-dandruff product. </li>

<li> If planning on a therapeutic drug, we need to account for the immune response, the localization of the product and the cost of developing it.
<br>
 a. Using magnetic nanoparticles to allow localization of a drug to the target site.<br>
 b. Using a cocktail of enzymes to make it more effective. </li> </ul>
<li> If the idea is still to be used on walls, then we can think about using the engineered organism to produce our enzyme upon induction.
<br>
 a. The organism can be incorporated into bricks or paints.</li>
<li>For expressing bacterial chitinases, <i>E.coli</i> is a good choice whereas Eukaryotic chitinases are best produced in Eukaryotic cell lines like <i>Pichia pastoris.</i>  </li>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Dr. Allshire enlightened us with the emergence of antifungal resistance and the consequent need for new antifungal agents. As a result, we wanted to ensure that our recombinant chitinases would help resolve this issue.

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Our project would be successful only if it happens to be of any use to the common man. Our initial idea was to engineer a hollow capsule that would carry our recombinant chitinase to the human body. Dr. Agarwal’s expertise in nano-particle drug-delivery systems proved to be of great help to us. He stated that nano-encapsulation of our recombinant chitinase would be an easier and efficient technique than a capsule. His advice of using Poly Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid (PLGA) as the nano-polymer was incorporated into our project as it would elicit a very minimal immune response. Furthermore, he also stressed the importance of using stabilizers like Trehalose for increased shelf-life of the drug.

<li>Even though most of the drugs do not take into account active targeting during their manufacture, it is still a better option to use it. Active targeting is able to significantly increase the quantity of drug delivered to the target site compared to free drug or passively targeted nanosystems.

  <li>Thus, it becomes imperative to “see ahead of the curve” so to speak, and assess whether the drug is likely to be valuable in the future, more so than in the present.</li>
<li>Dr. Ghooi outlined a rough strategy for us to follow: a) decide which specific fungal species we are targeting,b) Identify incidences of infection by that particular species from medical literature to determine its prevalence, c) Identify existing drugs in the market and determine their annual sales from the IMS database; pay special attention to the rate at which the sales are going up/declining, d) Make a realistic comparison of our compound to the existing drugs on the market based on factors such as efficacy, safety, and price.</li>
<li>He also suggested that we pay close attention to the nature of clinical trials which we need to follow: they are likely to differ from conventional drugs since we are targeting invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.

He also helped us with structuring the handbook we made on the legal scenario of biotechnology in India.

  <p style="font-size:25px" align="center"><b>HUMAN SUBJECT RESEARCH</b>
  </p>

   <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Surveys are an integral part of iGEM projects. They serve as a convenient medium for understanding common public opinion. Like most iGEM teams, our team also required surveys to understand public interest and preferences, which helped shape our project. According to iGEM’s human subject research policies, teams are required to obtain approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Research Ethics Committee (REC) before performing any sort of non-invasive experiments on humans/human subject research.</p>

   <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Prior to the public release of our surveys, we consulted with Dr. Harilal Madhavan, a health economist and a faculty member of our institute. He helped us in redesigning and reframing specific questions in our surveys. He also stressed the importance of including objective questions rather than open-ended and subjective ones. This survey was then subject to thorough scrutiny by our PIs and other senior authorities of our institute, following whose approval we released it to the general public.</p>

   <p class="pl-20 pr-20">The initial description of the survey mentioned that the data collected would be solely used for record-keeping purposes and gathered the respondents’ consent through the survey. Moreover, the participants were free to withdraw from the survey anytime in between. Parents or guardians could fill the survey on behalf of minors, patients, or anyone who couldn’t attend the survey only with the individual’s prior consent.</p>

  <p class="pl-20 pr-20"> Dr. Rashmi Mary Philip<br>
 Dermatologist, Amala Institute of Medical Sciences, Thrissur, Kerala
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Dr. Rashmi Mary Philip is a consultant dermatologist and a Senior Resident in dermatology at Amala Institute of Medical Sciences, Thrissur. Dr. Rashmi’s proficiency and experience in dermatology became really useful to us. She was able to give us common names of the fungal infections seen so that it would become easier for us to understand if we had to talk to affected patients in the future.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">She discussed in detail about dermatophytes, and how they cause superficial fungal infections. Dermatophytes have the ability to invade keratinized tissues, such as the skin, hair, and nails. Classified on the site of infection, dermatophyte infections include tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea unguium (nail infection), tinea capitis (scalp ringworm), and tinea pedis (athlete's foot), among others. She also briefed us about different other fungal species affecting humans.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">She was genuinely impressed with our project idea but also suggested expanding it as a therapeutic because pathogenic fungal spores would persist in the environment even after removing fungi thriving on walls.

</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">His department comes across children with topical fungal infections regularly. They are caused by dermatophytes. Immunocompromised children, especially those who have undergone solid or liquid organ transplants, are prone to life-threatening fungal infections. They are commonly infected by Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Mucorales. He discussed in detail the different types of infections caused by them, covering the following pointers:

    <p class="text right">  Pathogenic fungi cause havoc in several kingdoms; the plant kingdom is not an exception to this. Rubber is a major crop cultivated in our state Kerala and hence is a major source of income for many families over here. The sight of the spraying of fungicides in rubber plantations made us curious about the fungal infections in rubber trees. To know more about the diseases caused by fungi in plants, we contacted a local rubber farmer. From the conversation and a booklet he shared with us, we learned a lot about the diseases found in rubber.
    </p><h3 class="text-center"><strong>FUNGAL INFESTATION IN RUBBER: A FARMER’S PERSPECTIVE</strong></h3>
    <br>
    <p class="pl-20 pr-20">“Infestation by Phytophthora spp. causes rotting of fruits and abnormal leaf fall during the early monsoon period. We generally spray the Bordeaux mixture prior to monsoon to prevent infestation. However, the practice is often not appropriately done considering the labor cost and profit. Lack of treatment often leads to heavy loss in production. These days, oil-based copper oxychloride is substituting Bordeaux mixture. In nursery plants, during heavy monsoon, Phytophthora causes shoot rot. From January to March, mist leads to an outbreak of powdery mildew. Oidium haevea is thought to be responsible for this. Tender leaf edges roll inwards to fall, and old leaves show necrotic shots. The overall production of rubber trees decreases. To prevent the outbreak of powdery mildew, sulfur dust is sprayed along with early morning mist. Canker of the bark occurs in tapping channels in moist weather, leads to unnecessary loss of latex. During heavy rains, black rot occurs in renewed barks of tapping channels. Phytophthora and Pythium cause both these diseases. Disinfection of tapping channel with Mancozeb and Dithane is done weekly to prevent infection.”

    <br>

    <p class="pl-20 pr-20">We could have dived deep into the issue, but several constraints held us back. We worked on fungal samples that we collected from the walls of our institute. We observed that these cultures did not contain plant pathogenic fungi. Therefore, it would have been challenging to test the activity of our recombinant chitinases. Furthermore, the stability of enzymes in external settings was a serious concern then. However, we plan to expand our project to the agricultural sector also.</p><br>
