<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Collaborations are one of the most exciting aspects of iGEM. It results in an exchange of ideas with various teams from all over the world. The entire process of groups sharing ideas, troubleshooting each other's problems, or helping out each other in data collection justifies one of the core ideas of iGEM, i.e., making and exchanging scientific resources for the benefit of a more extensive section of the scientific community.</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">This year, we were able to reach out to multiple teams within and outside of our country. Interacting with other groups, understanding their projects, and helping each other out was indeed a  delightful experience. Thanks to technology, the pandemic was never an obstacle to the national and international collaborations we undertook. Furthermore, we are highly grateful to all the teams that participated and contributed to our collaborative efforts.</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Here we present the collaborations that our team was involved in:</p>
<br>
 <h3><b>1. Mycoexpo</b></h3>
 <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Fungi are often pictured to be dull and dreary organisms. <a class="text-warning" href="mycoexpo.html">MycoExpo</a> was the first open collaboration organized by our team to let the iGEM community appreciate the vast diversity of vibrant and colourful fungi present in our biosphere. The teams were asked to capture various microscopic and macroscopic fungi around them with the help of cameras and microscopes. Our team provided a detailed protocol for collecting and visualizing the fungi under a microscope. We had received entries from our Principal Investigator, Dr Ravi Maruthachalam, and many other iGEM teams around the globe; </p>
 <p class="pl-20 pr-20">iGEM UTEC, iGEM FCB-UANL, iGEM Brno_Czech_Republic, iGEM Lethbridge HS, iGEM RUBochum, iGEM Ecuador, iGEM IISER-Tirupati. We are grateful to all the teams who have participated in this exciting photo exhibition.</p>

             <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Our Team had successfully collaborated with Team Ecuador to mutually benefit from each other's ideas and successfully implemented those ideas into our respective projects. We shared our experiences and thoughts on different aspects of the project focussing primarily in project modelling. Both sides indulged in proficient and detailed discussions on how we could improve our modelling designs to reflect our work in a more apt and precise way.</p>

             <p class="pl-20 pr-20">One such area was “Expression of protein by cell after induction with IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) .” Our team was keenly interested in predicting the protein release kinetics when the host cell is induced with IPTG. In this regard, we have surveyed multiple pieces of literature; analyzing related models, extracting essential information, and implementing those ideas while building up our model. However, we missed some of the parameters which should have been considered during the process. Here, the Ecuador team came to our rescue filling the gaps in our model by providing us with the essential parameters that needed to be incorporated into our model to predict the protein output correctly.</p>

             <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Another major area for collaboration with Team Ecuador was the delivery mechanism for our respective final products. Here we pitched in the idea of nanoparticles as an effective and safe delivery mechanism. Both teams had quite intense and analytical discussions regarding this. They concluded that nanoparticles are indeed the best possible way to deliver our final products (Chitinase enzyme in our case and dsRNA for team Ecuador). To validate the feasibility of our claim, we had an interaction with Professor Alexis Debut who is a faculty at the Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, Sangolquí, Ecuador. He verified that nanoparticles such as PLGA (Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid))  is one of the best delivery mechanisms we could use to deliver our products. He also briefed us about different techniques that could be used for encapsulating proteins in PLGA nanoparticles. His valuable insights also helped us to develop a mathematical model to predict the decay of PLGA and thereby calculating the approximate release time of our engineered chimeric protein at physiological conditions.</p>

             <p class="pl-20 pr-20">In short, this collaboration helped both our teams to rectify our shortcomings and design and develop new innovative models and techniques to improve our projects in significant ways.</p>

<h3><b>5. SDGs video</b></h3><br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> iGEM encourages teams to build projects to solve local challenges faced by the community. The projects become even more significant when they aim to tackle global issues addressing the pressing problems associated with environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. Realizing the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs) formulated by the UN, iGEM Patras decided to create a video compilation where each team addressed the SDGs that their project was addressing. The video was made by our team members Sagnik Saha and Sayanthana Benny. Here we list two SDGs that our project addresses:

<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> <b>Goal 3: Good health and well-being</b></p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> Since fungal diseases were on the rise and of great concern during the Covid-19 pandemic, our team decided to develop a chimeric antifungal therapeutic drug capable of fighting against Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs) in various immunocompromised patients.</p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><b>Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production</b> </p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> By developing a therapeutic drug through efficient use of natural resources i.e enzymes, we fulfil the SDG Goal 12 criterion.</p>

  <h3><b>8. Biodoodle Drawing Event by iGEM iBowu_China</b></h3><br>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Art is a powerful and effective way to communicate science to the general audience. This was a worldwide collaboration where teams had to draw/design a biological concept in an artistic way. All the drawings would then be compiled and published as a colouring book for K-12 readers. This was a fantastic opportunity to unleash our creative skills on an international platform. One of our volunteers, Gayatri Kandapal, submitted a beautiful drawing of the lungs with a brief description.</p>
  <h3><b>9. iJET Challenge by iGEM TU Darmstadt </b></h3> <br>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">iGEM encourages the development of an intercultural network between teams worldwide. By filming a short video of throwing an iJET paper plane and transforming ourselves in our lab coats, the iGEM TU Darmstadt was able to connect various teams across the globe virtually. The videos were often shot near important landmarks, bringing out the International aspect of the collaboration. Our team members Shrutika Sansaria, Rutika Sansaria, and Udit Tyagi filmed and submitted a short video clip of us sending an iJET paper plane. The experience was really enthralling, and it helped to take our minds off from the busy and hectic lab schedules.</p>

  <h3><b>10. Promo video script translation for Patras.</b> </h3><br>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">iGEM is an international platform that hosts the participation of hundreds of teams coming from diverse backgrounds. Scientific communication of their project to all the people across the globe can be a challenging and daunting task. Language barriers should never become a barrier to communicate with the widely rich community of iGEM projects. Keeping this in mind, we helped the iGEM Patras translate their Promo video in two different languages; Malayalam and Hindi. The translation was done by our team members Sheba Cheeran and Udit Tyagi.</p>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Taking inspiration from this collaboration, we translated our iGEM promotional video to various Indian languages catering to its linguistic diversity.</p>
