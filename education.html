<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> Synthetic biology has always been a fascinating subject to many of us; this was the core reason for our participation in iGEM. However, throughout the project, we understood that the masses were unaware of synthetic biology and its potential. Taking this into account, our team conducted and was involved in a multitude of outreach activities directed at propagating synthetic biology among the masses. To make the entire process more effective, we carefully designed different methods to cater to the needs of varying age groups. The extensive publicity provided by the team's PR department (through Whatsapp, Instagram, Twitter, Slack and other social media platforms) also helped gain enormous participation for every event conducted. The outreach activities of our team are broadly aimed at four different age groups, namely:<p>

<ol class="ordered-list">
<li>10-15 years (Middle Schooler)</li>
<li>15-18 years (High Schooler)</li>
 <li>18-23 years (Collegiate level)</li>
<li> 23 years and above (Researchers in STEM)</li></ol>
<br>
<h3>Category 1: Middle Schoolers (10-15yo)</h3>
<br>
<h3>SYNBIOVERSE: Synthetic Biology book for Kids</h3>
<br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> The middle school curriculum of our country does not teach children about synthetic biology. An illustrated book seemed to be an excellent way for us to introduce the basic concepts of synthetic biology to curious middle schoolers.  </p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">The book's content was designed and created by team members and volunteers (juniors in the college), keeping in mind the target audience is kids. The preliminary drafts of the books were shown to kids and incorporated their suggestions of simplifying certain concepts. Furthermore, the book was also reviewed by middle school teachers, who suggested adding more illustrations and games. The book explains the fundamentals of the cell and its organelles, DNA and gene, a brief introduction to synthetic biology, tools for recombinant DNA technology, and how to synthesize human insulin in bacteria using these tools.
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">In the future, we plan to release an audiobook and translated versions of the book in the local languages so that the book reaches a broad and diverse audience. We distributed the books to kids in schools through their teachers.</p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">The highlights of the book include:</p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
 <li>Simplified concepts: The book straightforwardly explains the basics concepts without using complicated words. The descriptions under each heading were made short and precise so that the kid does not lose interest while reading the book.</li>
    <li>Rightly labeled illustrations: Visual representations of ideas help in understanding them more explicitly. Illustrations along with proper labels accompany all critical concepts. Often, these illustrations make the book quite attractive.</li>
<li>Important words highlighted: The words that require more attention or are important are highlighted to grab the readers' attention.</li>
 <li>'Did you Know' boxes: These boxes give a sneak peek into the concepts beyond the book's scope. They were introduced so that readers could get a basic understanding of such concepts, and those interested could learn more about them.</li>
<li>  Games: Children are generally fond of games. Introducing technical concepts through games would aid in a better understanding.</li></ol>

<h3>SYNBIO 1.0 </h3>
<br>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">SYNBIO 1.0 was an entirely cost-free four-day-long synthetic biology course/workshop for students between 15 and 18 years. The workshop was conducted for 11th and 12th graders of Rajagiri Public School, Ernakulam, Kerala, through Google Meet. A meeting with their school teachers helped us learn the extent of prerequisite knowledge children had, which greatly facilitated the making of the study material. The Outreach department of the team carefully designed the course in a simplified manner to educate the senior secondary students (11th and 12th grade) about the fundamentals of synthetic biology.</p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20"> On each day, a 30-minute presentation was followed by a doubt-clearance session. At the end of each day’s class, we ensured to display pictures of our laboratory equipment and microbial cultures. Since the students were not having access to rigorous laboratory work due to the pandemic, the pictures we showed them gave them an essence of actual laboratory stuff. The analysis of the short quiz and the feedback form released after the workshop showed a considerable change in their understanding of the subject. Students were awarded certificates upon successful completion of the workshop. The study material and answers to the questions in it were also handed over to the teachers of Rajagiri School, Kalamassery and are now available online and accessible to anyone on the internet.</p>

 <p class="pl-20 pr-20">The latest batch of students had just joined our institute. With a fresh and curious mind to learn new stuff, they were open to learning about synthetic biology and the role of iGEM in propagating it. Therefore, we organized an online interactive session with the students. Around 175 students took part in the same. Being the first iGEM team from our institute, they were very much keen to know about our inspiration and motivation for choosing this project. </p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Specifically, a majority of the students were eager to learn if our project was to tackle the “black fungus" disease which had become a national emergency during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India. The goal of the project back then was to tackle the fungal infestation on walls as they were a reason for a plethora of respiratory illnesses in critical-care patients. </p>

Our presentation consisted of the following content:<br>
<ol class="ordered-list">
    <li>What is iGEM? </li>
     <li>Why iGEM?</li>
 <li>Some previous year iGEM projects</li>
 <li>Our project<br>
   a. The motive behind our project.<br>
   b. How was the idea proposed?<br>
   c. Brainstorming sessions<br>
   d. Solution </li>
</ul>
</ol>

<br>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Being a synthetic biology project, there was a visible confusion among the crowd about the safety and containment aspects of our project while working with GMOs. Moreover, many students wanted to volunteer to help our team. Also, the preparation for next year’s iGEM team began, with students coming forward with project proposals and discussions.</p>
        <br>
<br>
       <p class="pl-20 pr-20"> <b> A noteworthy question raised by a student:</b></p>
<br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Jacob: Fungi play a great role in the forest ecosystem. Can the accidental release of the GMOs used to produce recombinant chitinases prove to be detrimental to the forest ecosystem?</p>
<br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Answer: Through literature surveys, we found out that the chitinases we selected when expressed by E. coli gets trapped in inclusion bodies. This prevents the exposure of our enzymes to the environment. It may be detrimental to the forest ecosystem because it can have the potential to harm off-target organisms such as insects as they possess chitin in their exoskeleton. We are going through literature to know more.</p>

<h3>SYNBIO CONCLAVE</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">IISER Thiruvananthapuram has hosted and been a part of various talk series by researchers from around the globe. Such sessions have always motivated passionate researchers and have ameliorated their careers. They aid students in finding their research interests and introduce them to unfamiliar areas in science. Moreover, they also throw light on the cutting-edge research happening in each field. <p>
<br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Thence, a talk series highlighting the vast applications of synthetic biology in various fields seemed an engaging way to unveil Synthetic Biology- a developing area of science. SynBio Conclave hosted five different speakers from different walks of synthetic biology. </p>
<br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">The conclave received around 300 registrations from all over the world, majorly consisting of graduate students and research scientists. </p>
