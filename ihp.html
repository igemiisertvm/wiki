                          <h2>HUMAN PRACTICES</h2>
      <h3 align="center"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
      <h3><b>Our Story</b></h3>
      <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Amidst the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, a group of undergraduate students from IISER Thiruvananthapuram came across iGEM. Being extremely keen on synthetic biology and recognizing the potential iGEM had to develop their interest in synbio, they decided to give it a shot.
      </p>
    <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Our search for a plausible iGEM project led us to scour through numerous wikis of erstwhile iGEM teams. Catechewing coli- an eco-friendly enzyme to remove paan stains from walls by iGEM Ruia Mumbai 2018 grabbed our attention. Taking inspiration from their project, we explored many different issues, primarily prioritizing environmental concerns.
  </p>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">We also observed black patches on walls, later identified as a collection of several mold species. We decided to develop an antifungal enzyme in the form of recombinant chitinases to eradicate black mold thriving on walls of buildings because they were nasty to look at. We started working along this line and identified a few fungal species growing on our campus’ walls. Our interactions with protein biologists helped us design gene sequences that would later produce our recombinant chitinases.
  </p>
    <p class="pl-20 pr-20">  Dr. Binod Parameswaran pointed out the difficulties of manufacturing an enzyme for application in external settings due to concerns over its stability and the high cost-benefit ratio. He suggested that we could make a more significant impact through our project by showing us the plight caused by fungi in mainly two domains: health and agriculture.
  </p>
    <p class="pl-20 pr-20">  Prevention is better than cure. Developing an enzyme that would remove molds from walls would substantially prevent the diseases they caused. This belief of ours largely met with dissent from many medical experts whom we consulted to assess the impact of our project. Regardless of medical experts not being our direct stakeholders, our correspondence with them helped us realize that removing molds from walls would not significantly reduce the fungal spore contamination in the atmosphere. The persistent fungal spores can still lead to severe complications in people. Additionally, our parallel dialogue with local farmers <a class="text-warning" href="integrated_human_practices.html#Farmer">(Farmer)</a> pointed at agricultural losses due to fungal infestation, especially in rubber plantations.
  </p>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">Consequently, we were open to two choices:</p>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">During this time, India witnessed an enormous soar in the number of Mucormycosis cases as a post covid complication. This essentially helped us in resolving the dilemma and chose to work on the former option, ergo <b>‘Moldemort’</b>- a class of antifungal therapeutics to invasive fungal infections. In addition to the recombinant genes we had already designed, our team developed a new gene from two bacterial species, mainly to target <i>Rhizopus spp.</i>, which is one of the main causative agents of Mucormycosis.</p>
  <p class="pl-20 pr-20">We also indulged in interactions with our stakeholders through surveys and awareness programmes to educate the public about fungi and their menace. Their feedback and suggestions, along with a discussion with Dr. Rachit Agarwal, were instrumental in designing our drug-delivery system. Dr. Ravindra Ghooi’s guidance helped us devise a plan for implementing the future aspects, including commercialization and clinical trials.

<p class="text right">  Pathogenic fungi cause havoc in several kingdoms; the plant kingdom is not an exception to this. Rubber is a major crop cultivated in our state Kerala and hence is a major source of income for many families over here. The sight of the spraying of fungicides in rubber plantations made us curious about the fungal infections in rubber trees. To know more about the diseases caused by fungi in plants, we contacted a local rubber farmer. From the conversation and a booklet he shared with us, we learned a lot about the diseases found in rubber.
</p><h3 class="text-center"><strong>FUNGAL INFESTATION IN RUBBER: A FARMER’S PERSPECTIVE</strong></h3>
<br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">“Infestation by Phytophthora spp. causes rotting of fruits and abnormal leaf fall during the early monsoon period. We generally spray the Bordeaux mixture prior to monsoon to prevent infestation. However, the practice is often not appropriately done considering the labor cost and profit. Lack of treatment often leads to heavy loss in production. These days, oil-based copper oxychloride is substituting Bordeaux mixture. In nursery plants, during heavy monsoon, Phytophthora causes shoot rot. From January to March, mist leads to an outbreak of powdery mildew. Oidium haevea is thought to be responsible for this. Tender leaf edges roll inwards to fall, and old leaves show necrotic shots. The overall production of rubber trees decreases. To prevent the outbreak of powdery mildew, sulfur dust is sprayed along with early morning mist. Canker of the bark occurs in tapping channels in moist weather, leads to unnecessary loss of latex. During heavy rains, black rot occurs in renewed barks of tapping channels. Phytophthora and Pythium cause both these diseases. Disinfection of tapping channel with Mancozeb and Dithane is done weekly to prevent infection.”

<p class="pl-20 pr-20">We could have dived deep into the issue, but several constraints held us back. We worked on fungal samples that we collected from the walls of our institute. We observed that these cultures did not contain plant pathogenic fungi. Therefore, it would have been challenging to test the activity of our recombinant chitinases. Furthermore, the stability of enzymes in external settings was a serious concern then. However, we plan to expand our project to the agricultural sector also.</p><br>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Understanding the problem</strong></h3><br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Fungal diseases have been on a rise with over 1 billion cases of fungal infections every year. Invasive fungal infections  (IFIs) result in approximately 1.7 billion deaths per year making it one of the most vicious diseases in the current scenario<sup>[1]</sup>. During the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a rapid increase in the IFI cases worldwide, especially in our country, India. IFIs also carry a 60-90% mortality rate among all ICU patients<sup>[2]</sup>. Although fungal infections have been on the rise, it wasn't until the wake of Covid-19 that this issue was brought to the limelight. Even before the pandemic, fungal infections had have been on a rise due to <b> increasing usage of medical devices such as catheters<sup>[3]</sup> or cardiac valves (formation of biofilms),</b>immunosuppressants and organ transplants.There are currently five classes of antifungal drugs such as Azoles, Polyenes, Echinocandins<sup>[4]</sup> etc. Most of these antifungal drugs target similar pathways involving ergosterol biosynthesis. Tackling these infections has proven difficult due to a limited repertoire of antifungal drugs, their costs, drug interactions, the routes of administration, and side effects like nephrotoxicity <sup>[5],[6]</sup>. Furthermore, the rampant use of these limited drugs raises the alarming possibility of developing drug-resistant fungal strains <sup>[7]</sup>. </p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Aware of this issue, our team at IISER-TVM set out to develop a solution to alleviate the suffering of millions of people across the world. We embarked on a journey to understand the underlying principles of fungal infections and tried to address the root cause of the issue. Almost immediately, the stark inadequacy of existing antifungal drugs was glaringly apparent. <b>Existing therapeutics not only foreshadow the emergence of drug-resistant fungal strains, as proven by many studies but may also have significant cytotoxic and nephrotoxic effects<sup>[8]</sup>.</b></p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><b>Our efforts culminated in the development of "Moldemort,"  a novel antifungal agent, which we believe holds the potential to reduce the global burden of invasive fungal infections significantly. </b></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Designing the Solution</strong></h3><br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Once we understood our problem, we conducted in-depth literature studies to formulate recombinant chitinases. We laid out the experimental plans planned out through intensive brainstorming sessions. To better understand and assess the problem, the team met various experts from diverse fields and significant stakeholders. </p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">The expert interactions we conducted greatly influenced our experimental plan. Our parallel interaction with stakeholders gave us insights into the potential broader impact of our project and methods to address the gaps between what society wanted and what we had. Furthermore, we shifted the project’s initial goal of tackling fungal infestation on walls to develop a novel antifungal therapeutic solution solely based on our stakeholders’ inputs. Additionally, we added BC2-our fourth recombinant chitinase combo, to our initial list of three. This gene was purely designed against Rhizopus spp., which is the causative agent of Mucormycosis.
</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Further studies on this matter led us to realize that India has a relatively higher load of invasive fungal infections among the affected Asian population. The need for affordable and effective antifungal drugs with minimum side effects dramatically increased the relevance of our project, particularly in the Indian scenario.

</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Our interaction with Prof. Moorthy made us rethink our goals. We then decided to streamline our project to a more specific target. Therefore, we focused on obtaining a recombinant chitinase with a higher chitinolytic activity than the wildtypes.

<h3>A. 1st Interaction (22-05-2021)</h3>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><strong>Status of project before the discussion:</strong></p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>The team had designed 4 different recombinant chitinases that include domains from various plants and bacteria.</li>
   <li>The primary application of our chitinase was to remove moulds from walls. There were some ideas of using it as a therapeutic drug or as a biocontrol agent in Agriculture.  </li>
   <li>If a therapeutic drug was the choice, we planned on using nanoparticles as a drug delivery vehicle.</li>
  </ol>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>Using only enzymes on walls had several challenges like:
    <br>
        a. Enzyme optimum temperature and pH might not be maintained. <br>
        b. Enzyme loses stability quickly. <br>
        c. The cost of production would be very high. <br>
        d. The protein solution might induce the growth of some other microbes. <br>
        e. The enzyme solution might have non-specific activity (affect insects).</ul>
         <li> Some types of stabilizers (polysaccharides) could be added like sorbitol or starch to increase the shelf life of our protein. </li>
<li>Could look into further applications like:<br>
a. Therapeutic Drug with the proper delivery mechanism. <br>
b. Biocontrol agent in Agriculture. <br>
c. As an ointment or anti-dandruff product. </li>

<li> If planning on a therapeutic drug, we need to account for the immune response, the localization of the product and the cost of developing it.
<br>
a. Using magnetic nanoparticles to allow localization of a drug to the target site.<br>
b. Using a cocktail of enzymes to make it more effective. </li> </ul>
<li> If the idea is still to be used on walls, then we can think about using the engineered organism to produce our enzyme upon induction.
<br>
a. The organism can be incorporated into bricks or paints.</li>
<li>For expressing bacterial chitinases, <i>E.coli</i> is a good choice whereas Eukaryotic chitinases are best produced in Eukaryotic cell lines like <i>Pichia pastoris.</i>  </li>
</ol>


<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><strong>Status of the project after incorporation of suggestions:</strong></p>

<li>A crude design of the upcoming experimental assay was made but a lot of doubts regarding the method to be used arose. Hence a second meeting was required with Dr. Binod to clarify the doubts.
</li> </ol>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ol class="ordered-list">
  <li>Suggested to use DNS (3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid) assay which was a common and conventional method to measure chitinase activity.</li>

<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><b><i> Targeting multiple molecules in the fungal cell wall at the same time would be a more efficient way to solve the issue of antifungal resistance.</b></i>
<br>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Robin Allshire is a Wellcome Principal Research Fellow and Professor of Chromosome Biology at the University of Edinburgh. His research focuses on epigenetic inheritance: establishment and transmission of specialized chromatin domains. He discovered an epigenetic mechanism that allows fungi to develop resistance to antifungal drugs without alterations to their DNA, which helps understand how pathogenic fungi become resistant to the limited number of available antifungals agents in clinical and agricultural areas. </p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20">Dr. Allshire enlightened us with the emergence of antifungal resistance and the consequent need for new antifungal agents. As a result, we wanted to ensure that our recombinant chitinases would help resolve this issue. An exact solution cannot be designed without rigorous laboratory experiments; however, we could conduct studies on antifungal resistance in 96-well plates. Moreover, targeting multiple molecules in the fungal cell wall (glucan and chitin) simultaneously can increase the success percentage of the antifungal activity of the drug.</p>
<p class="pl-20 pr-20"><strong>Before:</strong></p>
